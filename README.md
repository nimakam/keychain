# Keytag

Keytag provides consumers with a simple and secure means of using a self-defined digital identity, tied to their personal information.

## Web 3.0 protocols and standards

Web 1.0 took advantage of protocols like SMTP, HTML and HTTP for email and hypertext transfer to enable information sharing. Similarly Web 2.0 took advantage of technologies like CSS and AJAX to provide interactive apps. A new wave of concepts like digital value and trust are maturing along with public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the Web 3.0 era, standards and protocols will evolve, that can be implemented directly onto public blockchains in the form of cryptoeconomic protocols.

## Universal identity

Currently identity is fragmented across heterogenous platforms (Facebook, Google, Apple, Twitter, etc.) and media (Login, Physical documents, etc.). Universal identity is the set of permission-less decentralized protocols and supporting standards, that enable people and organizations to self-define their digital identities, and to interoperate securely and seamlessly. Just a few use cases include: Managing and leveling up trust connections between people or organizations, managing public reputation, sharing of personal information. That is just to name a few ...

In the Web 1.0 era, with the introduction of email addresses, people gained the ability to communicate using an email account and provider of their choosing. Universal identity will parallel what the email protocols, and the concept of a personal email address, did for digital communications.

## Decentralized applications

Many of today's widely used applications, like social networking (Facebook), micro blogging (Twitter), ride hailing (Uber) and others, can and will be reconstructed using the standards based, decentralized building blocks of Web 3.0. Although the back-ends of all these applications can run on smart contracts in a well-defined decentralized manner, the user facing aspects will likely be operated by centralized, locally regulated technology brands. These apps will compete on the basis of brand identity, and regulation limitations amongst others.

These apps can, and likely will, use the same standard decentralized identity, personal data management protocols. Keytag will capitalize on the enormous opportunity produced by the upcoming digital transformation wave, to build a well-branded, highly usable set of apps to support universal self-defined identity at scale.
