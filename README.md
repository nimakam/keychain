# Keychain

Keychain provides consumers with a simple and secure means to use and manage their identity and personal data in the Web 3.0 world of decentralized applications.

## Web 3.0

Web 1.0 took advantage of protocols like SMTP, HTML and HTTP for email and hypertext transfer, similarly Web 2.0 took advantage of technologies like CSS and AJAX. At the time of this writing, concepts like digital value and trust are evolving in blockchain ecosystems like Bitcoin, Ethereum and others. We expect the web to evolve with help of new protocols that leverage concepts of digital value and trust on top of decentralized blockchains. This evolution can be called Web 3.0.

## Self-sovreign identity and personal data management

As the time of this writing, majority of consumer digital identity is entrusted to a few companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple etc. These are central entities that are vulnerable to information breaches, event though the risk is small. Many of these companies also have business models that contradict with a genuine sense of stewardship for their customers' identity. In a decentralized digital ecosystem like Web 3.0, it is possible to for people to use and manage a self-sovreign identity since stewardship of their information can be entrusted to decentralized smart contracts. This means storing information like name, email and contact list on the blockchain securly and privately, while a smart contract manages access to that information based on the user's permissions. 

## Decentralized applications

Many of today's widely used applications, like social networking (Facebook), micro blogging (Twitter), Ride hailing (Uber) and others, can be reconstructed using the standards based, decentralized building blocks of Web 3.0. Although the backends of all these applications can run on smart contracts in a well-defined decentralized manner, the user facing aspects will likely be operated by centralized, locally regulated technology brands. The will compete on the basis of brand identity, regulation limitations amongst others.

These applications can, and likely will, use the same standard decentralized identity, personal data management protocols. By the same logic as above, self-sovreign identity and account management functionality will also best be surfaced to users by centralized technology brands. There is a large opportunity to build a well-branded, highly usable set of applications to enable self-sovreign identity and personal data management at large scale.
