# Keytag

Keytag provides consumers with a simple and secure means of managing and using a self-defined digital identity tied to their personal information.

## Web 3.0 protocols and standards

Web 1.0 took advantage of protocols like SMTP, HTML and HTTP for email and hypertext transfer, similarly Web 2.0 took advantage of technologies like CSS and AJAX. Currently, concepts like digital value and trust are going through an evolution as a result of developments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain communities. We expect the web to evolve on top of newly evolved protocols that leverage concepts of digital value and trust first introduced by public blockchains. This evolution is refered to as Web 3.0. In Web 3.0 standards can be implemented directly onto public blockchains in the form of monetizable protocols.

## Universal identity

Universal identity is the set of permissionless decentralized protocols and supporting standards, that enable people and other entities to self-define their digital identities, and have them interoperate with other identities in a variety of ways. Currently people's digital identities are fragmented accross heterogenous platforms and media. Universal identity will do what the email protocols and the concept of a personal email address did for digital communicationsm where suddenly, everyone was able to communicate with others with an email account and provider of their choosing. The potential interoperations accross universal identities are extensive and include: Managing and leveling up trust connections to people and entities, managing public reputation, management and sharing of personal infromation, just to name a few.

## Decentralized applications

Many of today's widely used applications, like social networking (Facebook), micro blogging (Twitter), Ride hailing (Uber) and others, can be reconstructed using the standards based, decentralized building blocks of Web 3.0. Although the back-ends of all these applications can run on smart contracts in a well-defined decentralized manner, the user facing aspects will likely be operated by centralized, locally regulated technology brands. The will compete on the basis of brand identity, regulation limitations amongst others.

These applications can, and likely will, use the same standard decentralized identity, personal data management protocols. Keytag will capitalize on the enormous opportunity produced by the upcoming digital transformation to build a well-branded, highly usable set of applications to enable universal self-sovereign identity at scale.
